<h1 align="center">CRON2.0</h1>
CRON2.0 is a scheduler application that automates the scheduling of cron jobs and also provides error notifications via email. It is a system designed to allow users to schedule their cron jobs easily and conveniently. Users can specify the frequency of the cron job, such as every minute, hour, or day, as well as the specific time and day of the week. The application also includes an authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access the scheduler.
One of the key benefits of this application is that it removes the stress of developers having to set up cron jobs manually, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. With this scheduler, developers can automate the process of scheduling cron jobs, freeing up their time to focus on other critical tasks.
